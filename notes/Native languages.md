One of the things I want to get worked out is how to get Native language support in Wikidata. For those, like Cherokee, that have written language and full keyboard/encoding support, we should be able to turn those languages on and record the official names in Native languages the tribes are known by. While this would be a somewhat symbolic feat, it's going to take some effort to get there, and we might be able to make some political hay out of it with the Wikimedia Foundation, particularly if done at an international scale.
