I need to work out how we might deal with the preferred name issue with the notable bellwether being Diné. In a lot of ways, it makes sense to rework primary and other labels, leaving the current predominant name like Navajo in as an alias. Ultimately, this is really the call of the Tribe, and I want to be cautious in going to far too quickly. I see Diné people still referring to the Tribe and themselves as Navajo in many contexts, but the two names seem to be becoming more interchangeable.
