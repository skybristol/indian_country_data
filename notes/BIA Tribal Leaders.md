This is a listing of the federally recognized tribes that gives us a few different names to work with, who the BIA has listed as the current leader of the Tribe (including their title, which is handy), location of a government headquarters, and some web sites.

It may be that the tribal leaders data becomes the lynchpin for working with the [[BIA Spatial Data]], because the GIS tables do not seem to have any kind of unique identifier concept to the Tribe. I'm thinking the "Tribe" property in Tribal Leaders could be the linking factor...maybe.

Ultimately, the information on who the elected official is for the Tribe and dates associated with elections are suspect. The Tribes themselves are the only authoritative source for all of that.

The [CSV](https://www.bia.gov/service/tribal-leaders-directory/tld-csvexcel-dataset#additional-information-2) ends up being the most reasonable source to work with for the most part.

There are also two [feature services](https://biamaps.doi.gov/server/rest/services/Hosted) I haven't yet explored. The "DO NOT DELETE" (ha ha) one of these is maybe related to whatever generates the CSV.
