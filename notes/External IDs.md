One of the interesting things I see in some existing WD items for Tribes is the use of ExternalIDs. Once I get a [[Baseline of Federally Recognized Tribes]], I'll run some analyses through what all IDs are in play and think about how I want to work through them. There's a nice example of [ROR](https://ror.org/00p23dy23) in place used for Cherokee Nation. This is cool to see, and I want to track down why that ROR was registered and what its significance is.

### Note on ISNIs
I did find an interesting thing with the item for the [Diné](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q108266) pointing to an [ISNI](https://isni.org/isni/0000000472000739). I hadn't really dug into what ISNI identifiers are for until this one made me wonder. ISNI is the ISO standard identifier for contributors to media content. ISNIs seem like strange and imperfect identifiers by looking at this case. The descriptive metadata is kind of fascinating:

|   |   |
|---|---|
|ISNI:|0000 0004 7200 0739<br><br>https://isni.org/isni/0000000472000739|
|Name:|Navajo (Musical group or band)|
|Creation class:|Musical sound recording|
|Creation role:|performer|
|Titles:|Chants<br><br>Legends<br><br>Ribbon dance|
|Notes:|[https://www.muziekweb.nl/Link/M00000096591](https://www.muziekweb.nl/Link/M00000096591)|

At face value, this is kind of cool. I could (over)interpret this as attributing a unique sound and style of musical composition and performance to the Diné, which is quite true and appropriate. But they are not a "Musical group or band" or a "performer." Following the notes to a data system I've never heard of, there's a long narrative that might have been copied from a Wikipedia article and starts with a strange reference to Diné living in Canada.

This does raise a question I've had about a lot of the identifiers that have dropped into Wikidata over time. What exactly is their significance to the subject item? There's an implicit functionality of some identifier systems that may or may not line up with the subject item to which an identifier in that system has been applied.
