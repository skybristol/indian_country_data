One of the issues I ran into is a pretty big proliferation of redirected names in Wikipedia articles for the Tribes. Here's an example.

https://en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=query&titles=Coyote%20Valley%20Reservation&prop=redirects

Some of this is a matter of different names a Tribe is known by or titled in different circumstances or from different sources. The big part of it I need to look at is that I think there are cases where there is basically no Wikipedia article dedicated to describing the actual people as they are today, both as a distinct group of Tribal people and as a sovereign government. There's an article for their reservation and the textual content there may talk about the people, but there's no article for the people distinct from their reservation.

That just seems wrong to me, but how to fix it is another question. At some point I may get into the space of starting the writing of those articles. A better way, would be to leverage the type of practice that Wikipedia has of convening a group together to work on a project to build out a type of content. That would be a really cool thing to help bring about with the Tribes if I can develop the relationships and spark interest. But that's probably a long way off at this point.
