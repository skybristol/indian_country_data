One of the interesting areas I want to dig into after I get a [[Baseline of Federally Recognized Tribes]] nailed down is to start working up all the linkages on things like Tribal businesses. Case in point would be [Cherokee Nation Businesses](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5092178) which is linked to the [Cherokee Nation](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q14708404) via a founded by relationship. I need to explore:
- what all is currently linked in Wikidata
- what's in Wikidata but needs to be linked
- what properties are being used to link and is there semantic alignment
