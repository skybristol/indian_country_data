This is the initial thing I'm working on. We already have items in Wikidata that are a reasonable starting point for the Tribes, but I know we don't have all 574 U.S. Federally recognized Tribes identified. BIA's [[BIA Tribal Leaders]] is the best encoded source of the legal source that establishes the government-to-government relationship between the U.S. and the Tribes. [[Wikipedia articles for Tribes]] enter in because I suspect there are some of those that do not have Wikidata items associated with them and/or there may be better (in information quality and completeness) listings of Tribes in Wikipedia than we have in Wikidata. We also need to firm up the sitelinks between Wikidata entities and Wikipedia articles, though that is a bit of an annoying architectural anomaly in WD.
